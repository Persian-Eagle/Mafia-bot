# Town of Salem
Once, it was a only but a dream to be able to play Town of Salem in Discord, but now it's becoming a reality.

We're starting all over again. Currently we're implementing all the phases:
- Phases
- [ ] Morning, explain deaths
- [ ] Discussion
- [ ] Accusation, first voting round
- [ ] Defense, accused person gives defense
- [ ] Judgement, final voting round
- [ ] Verdict, reveals votes
- [ ] Last words
- [ ] Night

Note: Since people can DM each other, we're considering embracing the concept by removing any (or most) role reveals. That way dead people can continue to plea and frame others.
